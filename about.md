Here lies a collection of posts on random topics prompted by things I came across
while breaking other people's stuff. As it, for the most part, took some time
to figure things out, I wanted to have a place to write everything down and refer
to it later, once I inevitably find myself in the same or a similar situation,
and to possibly help others along the way.
